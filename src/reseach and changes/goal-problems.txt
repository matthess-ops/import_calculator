main goal:

Get some extra experience with localstorage and model/view/controller design pattern. And overall
experience with javascript. Also make a responsive website that is user friendly by saving
previouly used values. Therefore limiting the number of clicks the use has to perform
next time.

Problem:

From experience all the dutch import calculators are not great. Most of the have all or several of
the below problems.

-only a few countries
-only a few currencies
-sites are not responsive
-exchange rates are out of date
-not user friendly by not saving certain input values, for example last used country/currency
combination.
-no possibility to change the currency for a country. For example in chinese webshops it is commmon
that you pay in USD. However with the most dutch import calculators you cannot change the currency
from chinese Renmimbi to United states dollar
- set euro and usd as second and third option in list

Secondary goal:

Make a responsive website that fixes all the above stuff
